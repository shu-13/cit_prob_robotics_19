This repository is for the final report for the Probabilistic Robotics class 2019.
The task is to
* Create a grid world
* Move the agent to the goal by using a reinforcement learning method

## Results
The image Result_01.png is the result of the Sarsa version.
Here, alpha = 0.5, gamma = 1.0
The agent did reach the goal but it looks like the path isn't that efficient.

The image Result_02.png is another result of the Sarsa version.
Here, alpha = 0.8 and gamma = 1.0
This time, I set an obstacle and the agent managed to go around it.

## Future works
Doing this task was interesting. It is my first time trying out something related to machine learning.

I would love to get back to this code once I finish my thesis paper.
