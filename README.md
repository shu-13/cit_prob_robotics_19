This repository is for the final report for the Probabilistic Robotics class 2019.
The task is to
* Create a grid world
* Move the agent to the goal by using a reinforcement learning method

## Results
The image Result_01.png is the result of the Sarsa version.
The agent did reach the goal but it looks like the path isn't that efficient.
